# Asana-To-Slack Pusher

This repository contains a Node.js application designed to fetch tasks from a specified column in Asana according to a schedule (cron) and send them as a list to a private Slack channel based on the provided channel name in the environment variables.

## Setup
To run the application, follow these steps:

- Clone the repository to your local machine.
- Run `npm install` to install the necessary dependencies.
- Copy the `.env.example` file and rename it to `.env`.
- Fill in the required environment variables in the `.env` file:
- - `ASANA_TOKEN`: Your Asana API token.
- - `SLACK_BOT_TOKEN`: Your Slack API token.
- - `SLACK_CHANNEL_NAME`: The name of the private channel in Slack where you want to send the task list.
- - `WORKSPACE_GID`: The GID workspace in Asana where the tasks are located.
- - `CRON_MINUTES`: The frequency (in minutes) at which the application should fetch tasks.

## How to Run with Docker
After setting up the environment variables, you can start the application by running:
```docker run slack-pusher```

## Logging
The application utilizes `Winston` for logging purposes. Any errors or important information will be logged using Winston.

## Testing
Tests and TypeScript implementation are currently in progress and will be added in future updates.
